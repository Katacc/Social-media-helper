## Description / Plan
A program that uses user assigned folders depending on the mood and the cosplay of the picture (User puts photos into corresponding folders).

The program asks the user for the mood and cosplay they want to post and selects a picture randomly from specific category depending on the user input and moves it to a output folder.

## NOTE!
- For the random mood to properly work, there shouldn't be any empty mood folders.
The program might crash otherwise!


## Prequisites:
- Up to date vc redist packages
- Up to date g++ (c++ compiler)


## Changelog:
- Added possibility to randomize mood selection
